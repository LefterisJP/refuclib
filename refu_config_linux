#====REFU COMPILE OPTIONS START====#

#If YES then the library is built with some functions having default
#arguments, utilizing the C preprocessor. If NO they are build normally
#Accepted values for this option are YES and NO. Default is YES.
DEFAULT_ARGUMENTS=YES

# If YES then the malloc and calloc calls of the library check for
# failure and in case of failure log an error and exit the process.
# If NO then malloc and calloc are called normally.
#Accepted values for this option are YES and NO. Default is NO.
SAFE_MEMORY_ALLOC=NO

# If YES then the library's error logging will be verbose which basically
# means that every error will be printed in the appropriate log file stream
# Default is YES.
VERBOSE_ERROR_LOGGING=YES

# This option is the number of bytes that will be read each time by the library's 
# version of fgets. Must be a positive integer number. Default is 512
FGETS_READ_BYTESN= 512

# This is the multiplier by which a StringX's buffer will get allocated/reallocated
# by when there is a need for buffer extension. Also when the StringX gets initialized 
# this is how much bigger than the given String the buffer will be. Must be a positive
# integer. Default is 2
STRINGX_CAPACITY_MULTIPLIER= 2

# This is the multiplier by which a List's buffer will get allocated/reallocated
# by when there is a need for buffer extension. Also when the List gets initialized 
# this is how much bigger than the given initial size the buffer will be. Must be a positive
# integer. Default is 2
LIST_CAPACITY_MULTIPLIER= 2

# This is the size of a buffer that is used while reading the temporary RF_Strings
# with the RFS_() macro that take variable arguments. The buffer is used in the function vsnprintf()
# and it is always guaranteed to work but if the given string is smaller than the value
# provided here then a reallocate will occur. So provide here a value that would work
# out well for the strings in your project.
VSPRINTF_BUFFER= 512

# This is the default size in bytes of the main thread's Local Stack of the Refu Library
# All objects that are initialized as temporary objects such as with the 
# RFS_() macro or the RFXML_() macro are initialized in this stack. Make sure to provide
# a big enough value so that no overflow happens for your program. Default Value is around 1 MB
# This is just the value to be used if no specific value is provided at rfInit()
LOCAL_STACK_SIZE= 1048576

# This control whether to add a BOM(ByteOrderMark) at the beginning of newly
# created TextFiles. Provides YES to add and NO, not to. Default is YES
TEXTFILE_ADD_BOM= YES

# This option lets the library know the encoding format of its own source files and that of the files
# of the project it is used in. It is more than strongly recommended to leave it with the default
# value of UTF-8 here. The reason is simple. It is the most common and useful encoding for source code encoding
# and the Strings of the library are encoded in it internally. So changing this would results in a big overhead each
# time a string is initialized
# Accepted values are:
# + UTF-8
# + UTF-16LE
# + UTF-16BE
# + UTF-32LE
# + UTF-32BE
# Default value is UTF-8
SOURCE_ENCODING= UTF-8

# This option affects The extended thread objects RF_TreadX,
# and it denotes what should the default value of the size of the 
# message queue of a newly created RF_ThreadX. You still have the option
# to change that in run-rime through the initialization functions but
# if a value is not provided this will be the default value.
# Default value is 10
THREADX_MSGQUEUE_SIZE= 10
